  <h3>Synopsis</h3>
  <div class="panel"><p>Stephen Hawking was born on January 8, 1942, in Oxford, England. At an early age, Hawking showed a passion for science and the sky. At age 21, while studying cosmology at the University of Cambridge, he was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Despite his debilitating illness, he has done groundbreaking work in physics and cosmology, and his several books have helped to make science accessible to everyone. Part of his life story was depicted in the 2014 film The Theory of Everything.</p></div>

      <div class="col-md-4">
          <h4>My Brief History</h4>
          <p><em>My Brief History</em> recounts Stephen Hawking’s improbable journey, from his post-war London boyhood to his years of international acclaim and celebrity. Illustrated with rarely seen photographs, this concise, witty and candid account introduces readers to the inquisitive schoolboy whose classmates nicknamed him ‘Einstein’; the jokester who once placed a bet with a colleague over the existence of a black hole; and the young husband and father striving to gain a foothold in the world of academia.</p>

      <div class="col-md-4">
          <h4>The Grand Design</h4>
          <p>When and how did the universe begin? Why are we here? What is the nature of reality? Is the apparent ‘grand design’ of our universe evidence for a benevolent creator who set things in motion? Or does science offer another explanation? In <em>The Grand Design</em>, the most recent scientific thinking about the mysteries of the universe is presented in language marked by both brilliance and simplicity.</p>

    <div class="col-md-4">
        <h4>A Brief History of Time</h4>
        <p>Was there a beginning of time? Could time run backwards? Is the universe infinite or does it have boundaries? These are just some of the questions considered in an internationally acclaimed masterpiece by one of the world's greatest thinkers. It begins by reviewing the great theories of the cosmos from Newton to Einstein, before delving into the secrets which still lie at the heart of space and time, from the Big Bang to black holes, via spiral galaxies and strong theory.</p>

    <div class="col-md-4">
        <h4>Black Holes: The Reith lectures</h4>
        <p>“It is said that fact is sometimes stranger than fiction, and nowhere is that more true than in the case of black holes. Black holes are stranger than anything dreamed up by science fiction writers.”</p>
        <p>In 2016 Professor Hawking delivered the BBC Reith Lectures on a subject that has fascinated him for decades – black holes. In these flagship lectures the legendary physicist argues that if we could only understand black holes and how they challenge the very nature of space and time, we could unlock the secrets of the universe.</p>

      <div class="col-md-4">
          <h4>The Universe in a Nutshell</h4>
          <p>In 200 highly illustrated pages, Hawking is pushing the frontiers of popular physics beyond relativity and quantum theory, past superstring theory and imaginary time, into a dizzying new world of M-theory and branes.</p>

      <div class="col-md-4">
          <h4>Black Holes and Baby Universes</h4>
          <p>In his first collection of essays and other pieces - on subjects that range from warmly personal to the wholly scientific- Stephen Hawking is revealed variously as the scientist, the man, the concerned world citizen, and - as always - the rigorous and imaginative thinker.</p>

      <div class="col-md-4">
          <h4>On the Shoulders of Giants</h4>
          <p><em>On the Shoulders of Giants</em> tells a compelling story, using original papers from Einstein, Copernicus, Galilei, Kepler and Newton. Theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking explains how these works changed the course of science, ushering astronomy and physics out of the Middle Ages and into the modern world. </p>

          <h4>The Large Scale Structure of Space-time</h4>
          <p>A textbook for Physicists, this 1973 book explores two predictions of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity: first, that the ultimate destiny of many massive stars is to undergo gravitational collapse and to disappear from view, leaving behind a 'black hole' in space; and secondly, that there will exist singularities in space-time itself.</p>

          <h4>God created the Integers</h4>
          <p><em>God Created The Integersis</em> Stephen Hawking's personal choice of the greatest mathematical works in history. The book includes landmark discoveries spanning 2500 years and representing the work of mathematicians such as Euclid, Georg Cantor, Kurt Godel, Augustin Cauchy, Bernard Riemann and Alan Turing.</p>
